# NPC Endpoints #

*This documentation is WIP*

NPC *(Non-Player Character)* Endpoints are story, challenge, and lore nodes that have interactive elements provided by a REST API. Agent badges may be designed to interact with NPCs during contests, for specific challenges, or for communication or creative expression by holons or individual agents.
